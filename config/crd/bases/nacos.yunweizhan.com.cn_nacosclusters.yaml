                      the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                      of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                      traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                      the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                      be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                      routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                      features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                      within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                      a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                      when picking a node.

                      The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                      Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                      Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                      through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                      "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                      to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                      specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                      EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                      allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                      than a virtual IP.
                      "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                      routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                      "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                      (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                      as the clusterIP.
                      "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                      Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                        mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the host
                        to container and the other way around.
                        When not set, MountPropagationNone is used.

                        Behaves similarly to SubPath but environment variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment.
                        Defaults to "" (volume's root).
                        SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive.
